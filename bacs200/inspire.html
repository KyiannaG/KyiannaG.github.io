  "Failure is a feeling long before it becomes an actual result. It's vulnerability that breeds with self-doubt and then is escalated, often deliberately, by fear."
</p>
<p> Michelle Obama has many leadership qualities that I admire such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
     Inspirational- as first lady she was given the platform and has used her voice to bring awarness. 
  </li>
  <li>
      Compassionate- Any of the projects she has worked on has shown her passion and how much she truly cares about others well being. 
  </li>   
  <li>
      Honest- she was honest about her strengths and weakneses which is something I always look for in a great leader 
  </li>                                                                  
<p>
  As first lady Michelle used her position to have a postive impact on the things she was passionate about. She fought poverty, inequality and obesity which she has stated gave her purpose. I admire that she has brought attention to the issues she believed were important becasue many people who have the power to make a difference do not always do so.
